    "### 4.1. Euclidean Distance\n",
    "Euclidean distance can also just be considered as straight-line distance between two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For two vectors **x** and **y**, we can compute this as:\n",
    "$$ EUC(\\textbf{x}, \\textbf{y}) = \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Manhattan Distance\n",
    "Different from euclidean distance, Manhattan distance is a 'manhattan block' distance from one vector to another.  Therefore, you can imagine this distance as a way to compute the distance between two points when you are not able to go through buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this distance is computed as:\n",
    "$$ MANHATTAN(\\textbf{x}, \\textbf{y}) = \\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using each of the above, write a function for each to take two vectors and compute the euclidean and manhattan distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/distances.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see in the above image, the **blue** line gives the **Manhattan** distance, while the **green** line gives the **Euclidean** distance between two points."
